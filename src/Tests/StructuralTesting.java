/**
 * 
 * Task 2: White-box Testing: Structural Testing (51 marks) Consider the
 * following two methods in BigInteger class (their source code is shown in
 * Appendix):
 * 
 * public BigInteger gcd(BigInteger y)
 * private static int compareTo(BigInteger x, BigInteger y) (Note that this is a
 * private method, you can test it through the public method public int
 * compareTo(BigInteger val), which only calls this method)
 * 
 * For each method:
 * 
 * 1) Draw a control flow graph (5 marks)
 * 2) Design test casesthat can achieve 100% statement coverage (8 marks)
 * 3) Design test cases that can achieve 100% branch decision coverage (when
 * feasible) (8 marks)
 * 4) Design test cases that can achieve 100% condition coverage (when feasible)
 * (8 marks)
 * 5) Design test cases that can achieve 100% condition/decision coverage (when
 * feasible) (8 marks)
 * 6) Design test cases that can achieve 100% multiple condition coverage (when
 * feasible) (8 marks)
 * 7) Write and execute the test cases in JUnit. (6 marks)

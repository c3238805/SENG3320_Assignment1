## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - BigInteger.java
    - MPN.java
    - `tests` : the folder contains all the testing classes
        -BlackboxTesting.java
        -StructureTesting.java
        -DataFlowTesting.java

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
    -junit-platform-console-standalone-1.8.2.jar

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
